1. In this project, I performed end-to-end data analysis on a restaurant dataset provided by Cognifyz Technologies.


2. I identified the top cuisines and calculated their percentage distribution across all restaurants.


3. I analyzed different cities to find which city had the highest number of restaurants and the best average ratings.


4. I studied the price range distribution and visualized it using bar charts and histograms.


5. I compared restaurants with and without online delivery to understand rating differences.


6. I performed rating analysis to find the most common rating range and calculated the average number of votes.


7. I explored cuisine combinations and checked whether certain combinations received higher ratings.


8. I conducted geographical analysis by plotting restaurant locations using latitude and longitude to detect clusters.


9. I examined restaurant chains and analyzed their popularity and ratings.


10. I also analyzed review text to extract common positive and negative keywords and studied the relation between review length and ratings.
